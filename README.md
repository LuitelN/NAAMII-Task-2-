# Classification

## Overview

This project implements a supervised classification workflow using a tabular dataset. It includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes), hyperparameter tuning, evaluation on a held-out test set, and generation of predictions on a blinded test set. All steps are encapsulated in `Classification.ipynb`.
